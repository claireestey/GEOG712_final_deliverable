# Final Project - GEOG 712

### What is `GEOG712_final_deliverable`?

The goal of `GEOG712_final_deliverable` is to showcase the skills I’ve
learned during GEOG 712 this semester. I will do this by introducing a
component of my Master’s research project, the methodology of the
experiment, and some preliminary data analysis using a function I
created during the course. This GitHub repository will be used for my
own reference as I progress through the MSc program, but may also be
used by others studying similar concepts or organisms as a learning
tool.

### Structure of the repository

The table below outlines how information and data is organized in the
`GEOG712_final_deliverable` repository:
